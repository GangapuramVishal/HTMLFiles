        <h2>Biography</h2>
        <p>
            Mahendra Singh Dhoni was born on July 7, 1981 at Ranchi, Jharkhand located in the east corner of India.
             He studied at DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir where he was keenly interested in football and badminton. 
            He was the goalkeeper of his football team and was able to play for the district and state level. 
            But on the insistence of his football coach, he tried out to play cricket. 
            He was able to perform wicket keeping especially well which allowed him entry into a local cricket club called
             the Commando cricket club where he played from 1995-1998. In the 1997/98 season,
             his superb performances in the Vinoo Mankad Under-16 Championship attracted the selectorâ€™s eye.

            An attacking right-handed middle-order batsman and wicket-keeper, he is widely regarded as one of the greatest
             finishers in limited-overs cricket. He made his One Day International (ODI) debut in December 2004 against Bangladesh, 
             and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka. Dhoni holds numerous captaincy records such as most wins by an Indian captain in Tests and ODIs, 
             and most back-to-back wins by an Indian captain in ODIs.
